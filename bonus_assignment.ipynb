    "# Building Realistic Example Data\n",
    "This __optional bonus assignment__ is worth up to 5% of your final grade. It must be handed in by directly mailing the instructor (Christopher Brooks, brooksch@umich.edu) the assignment no later than Sunday September 27th at 11:59pm EST.

    "## Assignment Overview\n",
    "A constant need I have when teaching pandas is finding compelling example data to work from. Good example data is real-world, messy enough to need some manipulation, and fits reasonable constraints for a given problem. For instance, if I want to demonstrate joining multiple `DataFrame` together I might want one which is about people and one which is about purchases, where every person has an identifier and a bunch of personal information, and every purchase is linked to a given person. This is much more compelling then a bunch of random `np.ndarray` lists that I create inline while trying to give a lecture!\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I'm taken by domain specific languages, and in this part of the assignment you are required to build a processor for a simple domain specific language I have invented for the purpose of describing pandas `DataFrame` structures! It is expected that you will demonstrate your knowledge of regex here in particular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of the language I've created for this part of the assignment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "persons\n",
    "-------\n",
    "first_name\n",
    "last_name*\n",
    "phone_number\n",
    "random_number(5) as customer_number [1]*\n",
    "\n",
    "purchases\n",
    "---------\n",
    "isbn10\n",
    "credit_card_full\n",
    "random_number(3) as price\n",
    "random_number(5) as customer_number [1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example I describe two `DataFrame` objects by underlying a string with two or more hyphens. The string (`persons` and `purchases`) should be used as the variable name for the `DataFrame` objects created, and the language will always separate multiple `DataFrame` definitions by whitespace and hyphens as shown. Each column in the `DataFrame` is described on its own line with a string (e.g. `first_name*`). The string defines the column as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first word (e.g. `first_name` or `random_number(3)`) describes a function  and optional set of parameters to be called against a common `faker` object (an instance of the `Faker` class) for each entry in the resulting `DataFrame`. For instance, a value of `isbn10` implies that `faker.isbn10()` be called (note the default parameters), while a value of `random_number(5)` implies that `faker.random_number(5)` be called (with my supplied parameters).\n",
    "2. The first word *may* be followed by some whitespace and then an `as` statement. The `as` statement denotes that the following word be used as the name of the column. For instance, `random_number(3) as price` means that I'm looking for a column named `price` where every instance in the column is of a `faker.random_number(3)` invocation.\n",
    "3. If there is no `as` statement the name of the column should be the name of the function (with no parameters) I supplied, e.g. `first_name`.\n",
    "4. The definition may include a reference in the format `[#]` where the # sign is any number. This reference will be used across tables to show that the data in those tables should be of a similar set of values. This is so I can join between tables, which is a common need to demonstrate. In the example given I want each of the tables to have a column called `customer_number` where the data values in the column are such that `set(column1)==set(column2)`. Note that this doesn't mean the columns should be the same (they shouldn't), but just that they should include only 100% overlapping data. See point 6 for data distribution. **Clarification: In the example here, all of the `customer_number` values in `persons` should be unique (hence the `*`), but in the referencing collumn `purchases[customer_number]` the uniqueness is relaxed. This means that there does not have to be a 1:1 mapping as implied, and that it is a 1:many mapping, and in this case since `purchases` has repeated data you could verify this with `set(purchases['customer_number']).issubset(set(persons['customer_number']))`.**\n",
    "5. The sentence may end with a `*`. This indicates that the column described should be made up of unique data (no repeated elements). For instance, you wouldn't want a customer to be accidently assigned the customer number of another person! In the example above I decided I wanted the `last_name` of the persons and their `customer_number` to be unique in that table.\n",
    "6. By default a column should have 25% repeated data. e.g. something close to `len(column)==len(set(column))*1.25`. This lets me demonstrate operations such as left joins easily.\n",
    "7. By default, the length of each `DataFrame` created should be 99 items. This is both reasonable for most demonstrations, and a homage to The Great One.\n",
    "8. The functionality described should be executed in a cell magic function called `%%fakedata`, where the remainder of the cell is the definition in plain text. See https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config/custommagics.html for more details."
